The objective of this project would be to study the time series data and build a model that fits the time series accurately and forecasts future observations with minimal forecast error. CPI for medical care is highly fluctuating from year to year as there are a lot of factors governing it. Hence forecasting the data will not be an easy task. So, different methods are used to analyze the data and then find the model which fits the data better and provides minimum forecast errors.
